                        <h3>Beautiful Hotel.Amazing Location.</h3>
                        <p>Stayed with my wife from 18th to 20th November, visiting Kandy for the first time and I'm glad we chose to stay at Hurulu Walawwa! The breathtaking views we could see from our room were undeniable. The best part was the location, when you leave the hotel, you are in the main city center with lots of amazing shops, bars and restaurants, then when you enter the hotel you are immersed in peace and tranquility. In the mountains.</p>

                        <h3>Excellent Hotel I Will Never Forget</h3>
                        <p>I have never seen such a beautiful hotel in my life. Very kind people and the breakfast are excellent. Thank you Hurulu Walawwa Hotel. There are many things to see along with many of Sri Lanka's oldest structures.
                            We had only one night in this hotel but it was very comfortable. We had a huge family room which was perfect for a family of 5

                        <h3>Excellent accommodation that exceeded expectations.</h3>
                        <p>The check-in process was great. It was lovely after a long day of traveling/sightseeing to sit in comfy chairs and be given a lovely welcome drink while doing the check-in process.
                            The room was a big surprise, it was huge; it even had another king-size bedroom in an upstairs loft !!! The views across the valley were lovely. The staff was excellent and lovely to chat with.</p>
